# Integration Test Status

## Tests That Run Successfully ‚úÖ

### 1. **test-as-claude-desktop.js**
- **Purpose**: Simulates Claude Desktop MCP communication
- **Status**: Initializes successfully, lists tools, but times out on actual OmniFocus calls
- **What works**: Server startup, tool discovery, JSON-RPC protocol

### 2. **validate-mcp.js** 
- **Purpose**: Validates MCP configuration
- **Status**: Should work (configuration validation)

## Tests That Time Out ‚ùå

### Direct OmniFocus Access Tests
These all timeout when trying to access OmniFocus document or tasks:

1. **test-omnifocus.js** - Basic OmniFocus access test
2. **test-omnifocus-direct.js** - Direct JXA script execution
3. **test-direct-omnifocus.js** - Another direct access attempt
4. **test-list-tasks.js** - Tests list tasks script
5. **test-create-task.js** - Tests task creation
6. **test-simple-create.js** - Simple task creation
7. **test-inbox.js** - Inbox task operations
8. **test-crud.js** - Full CRUD operations
9. **test-crud-with-ids.js** - CRUD with ID verification
10. **test-real-omnifocus.js** - Comprehensive real-world test
11. **test-task-id-bug.js** - ID extraction bug test

### MCP Server Tests
These timeout when the server tries to execute OmniFocus scripts:

1. **test-mcp-client.js** - Full MCP client simulation
2. **test-server.js** - Server functionality test
3. **mcp-server.test.js** - Server integration suite
4. **test-claude-init.js** - Claude initialization sequence
5. **test-read-only.js** - Read-only operations test
6. **test-search-fix.js** - Search functionality test
7. **final-test.js** - Comprehensive final test

## Root Cause üîç

All tests fail at the same point: When trying to access OmniFocus data via JXA:
- `doc.flattenedTasks()` - times out
- `doc.inboxTasks()` - times out  
- `doc.projects` - times out

This suggests either:
1. OmniFocus 4.6 has a different API than expected
2. OmniFocus requires different permissions/setup
3. The JXA bridge has issues with the current approach

## Tests We Actually Use üéØ

For development, we primarily rely on:
1. **Unit tests** - Test the logic without OmniFocus (‚úÖ working)
2. **test-as-claude-desktop.js** - Validates MCP protocol (‚úÖ partially working)
3. **Manual testing** - With real Claude Desktop + OmniFocus

The integration tests were designed to test against real OmniFocus but are blocked by the JXA timeout issue.
