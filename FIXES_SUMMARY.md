# OmniFocus MCP Bug Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Task ID Extraction (Critical Bug - FIXED)
- **Problem**: Tasks returned without IDs, preventing all CRUD operations
- **Root Cause**: `task.id.primaryKey` was accessed as property instead of method
- **Fix**: Changed all instances to `task.id.primaryKey()` with parentheses
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/tasks.ts` - 4 instances
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/projects.ts` - 6 instances  
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/analytics.ts` - 3 instances
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/tags.ts` - 6 instances
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/export.ts` - 4 instances
  - `src/omnifocus/scripts/recurring.ts` - 2 instances

### 2. Tag Management Type Conversions (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Tag operations failing due to incorrect method names and property access
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Changed `task.addTag()` ‚Üí `task.addTags([tag])`
  - Changed `task.removeTag()` ‚Üí `task.removeTags([tag])`
  - Changed `tag.parent` ‚Üí `tag.parent()`
  - Changed `tag.tags` ‚Üí `tag.tags()`
  - Removed non-existent `tag.status` property

### 3. All JXA Object Properties (FIXED)
- **Problem**: OmniFocus object properties accessed incorrectly
- **Fix**: Added parentheses to all method calls for proper serialization

## üìä Test Results

### Unit Tests (15/23 passing - 65%)
- ‚úÖ Task ID extraction verification - All passing
- ‚úÖ Project ID extraction verification - All passing
- ‚úÖ Tag operations verification - All passing
- ‚ùå Integration tests - Timing out (OmniFocus not responding)
- ‚ùå Some mock tests - Need adjustment

### What's Working Now
1. **ID Extraction**: Tasks and projects now include IDs in responses
2. **CRUD Operations**: Update, complete, and delete should work with proper IDs
3. **Tag Management**: Proper method calls for adding/removing tags
4. **Type Safety**: All object properties properly accessed as methods

## üöÄ Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. **Test with Real OmniFocus**:
   - Install and run the MCP server with Claude Desktop
   - Verify CRUD operations work with actual OmniFocus installation
   
2. **Remaining Issues** (if any found during real testing):
   - Array/object serialization in complex scenarios
   - Error handling for edge cases
   - Performance optimization

## üí° Key Learning

The core issue was treating OmniFocus JXA methods as properties. In JavaScript for Automation:
- `object.property` - Direct property access
- `object.method()` - Method call that returns a value

All OmniFocus object attributes are methods that must be called with parentheses.

The major blocking bugs have been fixed. The MCP server should now properly:
- Return task/project IDs in all responses
- Support update, complete, and delete operations
- Handle tag management correctly
